#Google Developer's Machine Learning Course

This repo contains companion code for each lesson in [Google Developers' Machine Learning course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal).  You'll notice that the code presented here differs (sometimes quite significantly) from the code found in the videos.  In addition to the focus of each lesson, my code also pursues the following goals:

- Use python3
- Use current versions of widely used modules, not orphaned versions contained within sklearn or python distributions such as anaconda
- Include code for all topics covered within the lesson
- Improve the lesson's sample code for both readability and functionality
